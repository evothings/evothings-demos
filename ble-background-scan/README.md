# BLE Background Scanning Demo

This is a demo app of BLE background scanning. The code is written in JavaScript and uses an [custom version of the BLE Bleat library](https://github.com/mikaelkindborg/bleat/tree/scan-update). This library is included with the app.

This app works on iOS and Android with Evothings Viewer 1.4 or later (Viewer 1.4 will be available in the App Stores in May 2016).

Run the app from [Evothings Studio](https://evothings.com/download). 

Quick-start instructions:

* Download [Evothings Studio](https://evothings.com/download)
* Download the files in this repository
* Drag index.html into Evothings Workbench
* Connect from the Viewer
* Click Run in the Workbench to launch the demo app

You can also build a native app using the Apache Cordova Build system.
